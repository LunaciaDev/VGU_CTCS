## Setup

The repo is designed to be run inside Github Codespace, but you can have a look in `setup.sh` to adapt the setup locally.

1. Create a codespace from this repository
2. Copy `.env.example` into `.env`, fill in the credential for yourself.
3. Download `CompanyX.bak` and place it in `dataset/`. Create the folder if it does not exist.
4. Run `setup.sh`
5. You are all set!
